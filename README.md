# Constellation Code

**This constellation code attempts to define a format to define complex and large constellations in a concise way.**

TLEs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-line_element_set) represent the true position of the satellite.
However, using TLEs does not scale well for analyzing or simulating mega-LEO constellations.
The walker (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satellite_constellation) definition of constellations works well for circular orbits.
We extend this definition in a more generic way.

The format is as follows:
```
[WALKER]:[ALTITUDE]:[INCLINATION]:[PLANE PARAMS]
```
where:
- `[WALKER]` being 'D' for delta and 'S' for Star.
- `[ALTITUDE]` being the altitude in km. In case of elliptical orbits, the altitude is: `[APOGEE]/[PERIGEE]/[ARG_PERIAPSIS]`.
- `[INCLINATION]` being the inclination in degrees.
- `[PLANE PARAMS]` being the plane parameters in degrees, following the walker definition `[N_SATS]/[N_PLANES]/[F]`.

This represents one shell. Constellations with multiple shells are defined by adding more shells separated by a `+`.

In case the constellation has 1 plane, the walker can be omitted and the plane param is composed of only the number of satellites.

This definition is intended for orbital simulation.
It does not consider the initial epoch and therefore the position of satellites relative to earth may vary depending on how the parameters are interpreted.
As such, it's not suitable for representing GSO satellites.
